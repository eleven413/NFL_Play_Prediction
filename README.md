## About The Project


The purpose of this project was to assess the performance of different tree-based ensemble methods in tackling a simple classification problem. 

Specifically, we explore three methods with varying levels of complexities: a basic decision-tree, a general gradient-boosting algorithm, and an extreme-gradient boosting algorithm (XG-Boost).

The objective for each method was to accurately predict NFL plays (run, pass, field-goal, punt) based on game-time remaining, yardage information, score-differential, and time-out availability.
